# Titanic_Classification_ML
ML Project
In this data science project, we aim to build a predictive system to determine whether a person would have survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Using a dataset containing passenger information, including socio-economic status, age, gender, and survival outcomes, we will preprocess the data and select relevant features.

Our goal is to train machine learning models to accurately classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. By evaluating the models' performance, we intend to uncover the most critical factors that likely contributed to the passengers' survival during this historic disaster.

The project seeks to provide valuable insights into the impact of socio-economic status, age, gender, and other attributes on the likelihood of surviving the Titanic sinking, contributing to a deeper understanding of this tragic event.

For prediction we are using the 
Decision tree, logistic regression, random forest classifier, ada boost classifier, gradient boosting.and for data visuliazation we 
are using seaborn and matplotlib liabrary.
